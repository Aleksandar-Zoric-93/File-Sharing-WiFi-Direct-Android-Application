Click 'Accept' on the recieving device.

Once connected, you can click on 'Open Storage' to explore your device storage and choose an image to send.
Once the 'send' button is clicked, the 'server' device will recieve the file.

'Server' device must have default applications on device to open different file formats e.g. to open a PDF file, you must have a PDF viewer app.
